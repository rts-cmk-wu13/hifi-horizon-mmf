            If you haven’t received a refund after confirmation, first check
            your bank account again. Then contact your credit card company, it
            may take some time before your refund is officially posted. Next
            contact your bank. There is often some processing time of a couple
            of days before a refund is posted. If you have done all of this and
            you still have not received your refund after 7 days, please contact
            us at sales@hifi-horizon.com.
